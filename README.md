### Theory
A quick and simplified answer is that Lorem Ipsum refers to text that the DTP (Desktop Publishing) industry use as replacement text when the real text is not available. ... Lorem Ipsum is dummy text which has no meaning however looks very similar to real text.

### Analysis

**Time Complexity**

In the above algorithm we get the recurrence 

T(n)=2T(n/2)+O(n)
for the time complexity, which results in 

T(n)=O(nlogn)

So the final computational time to shuffle the given array is O(nlog‚Å°n).


**Space Complexity**

A quick and simplified answer is that Lorem Ipsum refers to text that the DTP (Desktop Publishing) industry use as replacement text when the real text is not available. ... Lorem Ipsum is dummy text which has no meaning however looks very similar to real text.
